# Tic-Tac-Toe in Python

This project is a **Tic-Tac-Toe game** implemented in Python, as part of my learning process with **NumPy** and matrix manipulation. The game is played directly in the **console**, using numbers.

---

## Features

- 3x3 board represented as a NumPy array.
- Players 1 and 2 take turns placing their pieces.
- Automatic victory check by row, column, or diagonal.
- Detects a draw when all positions are filled.
- Validates invalid inputs or already occupied positions.

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- **NumPy** library

---

## How to Play

1. Run the file `tictactoe.py` in the console.
2. The game will display the current board.
3. Each player chooses a **row** and **column** (0, 1, or 2) to place their piece.
4. Players alternate turns until someone wins or the game ends in a draw.
5. At the end, the board is displayed and a message announces the result.

## Project Objective

- Practice **NumPy concepts**, especially array manipulation.
- Build a simple but functional project playable in the console.

---

## Notes

- This code is for learning purposes and can be expanded in the future to a graphical or web-based version.
